# Tekprobe power supply
> A 1 channel power supply and adapter for the Tektronix's Tekprobe interface capable of supplying the duals voltages (-5V/5V DC and -15V/15V DC) and also the offset voltage (-1v to 1v).

## General Information
I've had for a few months a very good precision current probe with almost no use siting in my bench incapable of using it in my oscilloscope because it uses a propietary and obsolete Tekprobe connection. The idea of creating has been kicking arround in the back of my mind and by sure is not a new idea, see [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) to other webpages where I got the information, and while this design is mine for sure is inspired and remixed from the different sources.

## Features
- 1 channel but easily replicable to create a dual or triple power supply with the same power supply.
- Offset coarse and fine adjustment, something that other power supply project lack.
- Power from main through the help of a 19v power supply (To reuse an old laptop power supply)
